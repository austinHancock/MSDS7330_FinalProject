/* 
-----------------
*IMPORT RAW DATA*
-----------------
 - Made an edit to the excel table by adding a 'y' to the beginning of each year column
	- The reason for this is due to MySQL not allowing column names to be only digits
    - Additionaly, the 'y' was placed at the beginning of the name to avoid having to wrap the column name in quotes
 - Ran an initial import into MySQL from Excel using the MySQL add-in.
	- Data was imported into the tables 'raw', 'raw_trade'
